<p>The RTCSA conference series (now at its 26th edition) brings together researchers and developers from academia and industry for advancing the <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>theory</strong> to design and develop <strong>time-sensitive</strong> applications. All traditional applications in which temporal aspects need to be considered are in the scope of the conference. <strong>CPS</strong>, <strong>(Industrial) IoT</strong>, <strong>embedded systems</strong>, <strong>fog/edge/cloud computing</strong> are just notable examples. RTCSA welcomes both research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems. Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/" target="_blank">DBLP</a>.</p>	
		
		<p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. RTCSA 2020 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

    		<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe <strong>original</strong> work <strong>not previously published</strong> and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:</p>

    		<ul>
    			<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Full Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 10 pages</li>
    			<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Short Paper format</strong>: paper must fit within 6 pages</li>
    		</ul>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">Both types of submission must be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-columns, single-space, 10pt) and <strong>must include references and acknowledgements within the page limit</strong>.</p>

    		<p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be published by the IEEE Computer Society on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEExplore</a> and will be indexed by most search engines including <a href="https://www.scopus.com/" target="_blank">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.webofknowledge.com" target="_blank">Web of Science</a>, <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/" target="_blank">DBLP</a>.</p>

    		<p style="text-align:justify">By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that <strong>at least one author will register</strong> to the conference and participate by <strong>presenting the paper in person</strong>. RTCSA 2020 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital libraries and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>
